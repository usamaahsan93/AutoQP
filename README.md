# AutoQP: Genetic Programming for Quantum Programing
Automatically writing of quantum code using genetic programming. This code is the actual implementation of research **[AutoQP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9044554/ "AutoQP - IEEE Research Paper")**.

## Libraries
- Qiskit
- Numpy
- Copy
- Pickle
- OS
- Random

## How to Run
1. Run _testingDesk.py_ file, for main code.
2. Gates to use in the code can be changed in file _QGates.py_ .
3. _myQFn.py_ encapsulates the qiskit commands, which are later can be called to implement quantum oracles.
