# AutoQP: Genetic Programming for Quantum Programing
Automatically writing of quantum code using genetic programming. This code is the actual implementation of research **[AutoQP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9044554/)**.

## Libraries
Qiskit
Numpy
Copy
Pickle
OS
Random

## How to Run
Run testingDesk.py file, for main code.
Gates to use in the code can be changed in file QGates.py
myQFn.py encapsulates the qiskit commands, which are later can be called to implement quantum oracles.
